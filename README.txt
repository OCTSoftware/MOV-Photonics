This repository contains the files for the students to work on as well as all the data.
No installation is required as the files can be opened, edited, and run in Google Colab. To open a file automatically in Colab via link follow these steps:
- Get the Link of a file. E.g: https://github.com/OCTSoftware/MOV-Photonics/blob/main/Photonics_2_FO.ipynb
- Within the link exchange *github.com* with *colab.research.google.com/github*. E.g. https://colab.research.google.com/github/OCTSoftware/MOV-Photonics/blob/main/Photonics_2_FO.ipynb
Now this link can be e.g. added to a moodle course and will automatically open an individual notebook for each student. They can edit it but only save the changes if they save the notebook to their own drive.
